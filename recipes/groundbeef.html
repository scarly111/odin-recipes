    <p>These <em>ground beef stroganoff noodles</em> are a shortcut version of classic beef stroganoff in a one-pan version. <br> The ultimate comfort food with flavorful ground beef, mushrooms, and egg noodles.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh sliced chives or green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p><h3>Step 1</h3></p>
    <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
    <p><h3>Step 2</h3></p>
    <p>Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, season with salt, and saute, <br> stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
    <p><h3>Step 3</h3></p>
    <p>Add onion and ground beef. Cook, stirring, until meat is browned and crumbly, and onions turn soft and <br> translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with black pepper and cayenne.</p>
    <p><h3>Step 4</h3></p>
    <p>Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover <br> and stir thoroughly. Cover again and cook until noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes.</p>
    <p><h3>Step 5</h3></p>
    <p>Serve immediately with additional sour cream and green onions or chives if so desired.</p>
